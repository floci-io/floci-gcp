# Starts as root, reads the bind-mounted Docker socket's group so the
# unprivileged `floci` user can reach it on any host, then re-executes this
# script as `floci` via coreutils `chroot --userspec`, which also grants that
# group as a supplementary group. The second invocation falls through to exec
# the user's command. No gosu, no usermod: both would cost a package layer the
# base image does not otherwise need.
#
# Why: on native Linux Docker, /var/run/docker.sock is owned by root:docker
# with mode 660 and the docker GID varies by distro. On Docker Desktop
# (macOS/Windows) the socket is typically root:root (GID 0). Without the group
# fix-up below, floci (uid 1001, group 0) can open the socket on Docker Desktop
# but not on native Linux, which breaks Cloud Run, GKE, Managed Kafka and Cloud
# SQL emulation there. Discovering the GID at runtime handles every host
# transparently.
